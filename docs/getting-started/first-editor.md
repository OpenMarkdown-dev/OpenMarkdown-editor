# Your first editor

Two calls make an editor: `createEditorState` builds one document, and `mountEditor` shows it
in an element. When the document is a file, two more read and write its bytes:

```html
<div id="editor" style="height: 480px"></div>
```

```ts
import { createEditorState, mountEditor, openMarkdownFile, saveMarkdownFile } from "@openmarkdown-dev/editor";

let file = openMarkdownFile(new Uint8Array(await (await fetch("/notes.md")).arrayBuffer()));
const editor = mountEditor(document.getElementById("editor")!, createEditorState({ doc: file.text }));

const bytes = saveMarkdownFile(editor.getDoc(), file); // write these back
```

Give the parent element a height. The editor fills it and scrolls inside it.

Fetch the file as bytes (`arrayBuffer()`), not as text: `openMarkdownFile` keeps the file's BOM
and line endings, refuses bytes that are not UTF-8, and `saveMarkdownFile` gives back the
original bytes when nothing was edited. Decoding with `response.text()` first would already have
dropped the BOM and the line endings the save needs. See [Fidelity](../fidelity.md) for what
they keep.

After a save, make the bytes you wrote the new baseline, so that `editor.getDoc() !== file.text`
means "unsaved edits":

```ts
file = openMarkdownFile(bytes);
```

## Read and write the document as a string

When there is no file, only text (a form field, local storage), give the editor a string. It
keeps the document as a string in `\n`, so `editor.getDoc()` is the text.

```ts
import { createEditorState, mountEditor } from "@openmarkdown-dev/editor";

const state = createEditorState({
  doc: localStorage.getItem("notes.md") ?? "# Notes\n",
  host: {
    // isUserEdit is false for setDoc and other programmatic changes.
    onChange: (doc, isUserEdit) => {
      if (isUserEdit) localStorage.setItem("notes.md", doc);
    },
  },
});
const editor = mountEditor(document.getElementById("editor")!, state);

editor.getDoc(); // the current Markdown, as a string
editor.setDoc("# Replaced\n"); // new text, for example after the file changed on disk; scroll position kept
```

`host` holds the per-document callbacks. Every one is optional; see [the host](../guides/host.md).

## Modes

```ts
editor.setMode("source"); // "live" | "source" | "reading"
editor.mode(); // "source"
editor.view.focus(); // setMode does not move focus
```

- `live` (the default) renders Markdown in place and shows the source under the caret.
- `source` is the plain text, colored.
- `reading` is rendered and read-only.

Switching mode keeps the document, the selection and the undo history. It does not move
focus: when a button of yours calls `setMode`, the focus stays on that button, so call
`editor.view.focus()` afterwards if the user should be able to type right away. To start in
another mode, pass `mode` to `createEditorState`.

## Once per page: the environment

Window-wide capabilities, such as the color scheme, the clipboard and the UI language, are set
once, before the first editor mounts:

```ts
import { configureEditorEnvironment } from "@openmarkdown-dev/editor";

const media = matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)");
configureEditorEnvironment({
  language: "en",
  colorScheme: {
    current: () => (media.matches ? "dark" : "light"),
    subscribe: (cb) => {
      const on = () => cb(media.matches ? "dark" : "light");
      media.addEventListener("change", on);
      return () => media.removeEventListener("change", on);
    },
  },
  copyText: (text) => navigator.clipboard.writeText(text),
});
```

Without it the editor is light, English, and has no clipboard, external-link or spelling
behaviour. See [the environment](../guides/environment.md).

## Clean up

```ts
editor.destroy(); // when the editor leaves the page
```

`destroy` removes the view and stops following the color scheme.

## Several documents in one view

One state is one document, with its undo history, folds and mode. A host with several
documents (tabs, for example) can keep one state each and swap them into one view:

```ts
editor.view.setState(otherState);
editor.syncAmbient(); // re-apply the current light or dark scheme
```
